				<h2>Take Action</h2>
				<h3>What can you do to empower women?</h3>
				<p>Increase access to STEM activities: giving girls a little push into a previously male-dominated sector will allow them access to more technological oppertunities.</p>
				<p>Attend protests & marches: that's right, the old fashioned method of protesting will help inform more people of the cause!</p>
				<p>Post about it: a well-written post on social media could help you find other people who want equal oppertunities for women, and you may be able to teach more people about the problems with the gender gap!</p>
				<p>Promote STEM activities specifically for girls: activities like hackathons and coding camps can introduce young women to the world of STEM and open up a world of oppertunities!</p>

				<h2>Why Care?</h2>
				<h3>This simple question can change the world</h3>
				<p>- Gender equality leads to equal pay for men and women</p>
				<p>- Equality is critical to allow equal oppertunities for all, including education and careers</p>
				<p>- Stabilizing the gender gap will allow the US to grow and help to empower women in other countries</p>
				<p>- Everyone deserves to be treated the same, and YOU can be the change</p>
